Complete Tempreture Control Loop
1. Get actual tempreture reading from lm35 (Tempreture Sensor)
2. Measure current flowing through cooler and calculate error from setpoint
3. Update PWM duity cycle to adjust current value accordingly

Problems Accured
.................
1. Getting started with completely new family of devices
2. Deciding required communicaton peripherals for different sensors and host
3. Seting up device for USB bulk transfer
4. Unble to form complete loop due to unavailability of all the hardware components

Tasks Done
...........

-> Device Application2C
    Duplex communication with host
    1. USB  : Main data transfer protocol to exchange data and commands
    2. UART : Mostly as a debugg protocal
    
    Duplex communication with peripferal devices
    1. I2C  : Peripherals such as INA 
    2. SPI  : Peripherals such as PGA   
    
-> Host Application
Sample GUI application to send and receive data and instructions
    Seperate threads for 
    1. Data transmission 
    2. Data Receiving 
    3. GUI and Computaion

    USB Communication with device
        a. Detection of correct USB devices   // faltu
        b. Getting device interfaces from OS and configure device for bulk transfer
        c. Start data transmission and receiving threads
        d. Error handling and garbage collection
