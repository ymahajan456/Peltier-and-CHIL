DRV595

1. It is like  a H-bridge, which takes in input as PWM and gives out PWM voltage output and ripple current output.
2. This is basically a high-current power driver.


i. It has two modes of working:
	a. BD Modulation: Lower ripples and lower efficiency. Gives PWM output voltage on both pins with varing duty cycles, decided by the initial gain parameter.
	b. ISPW Modulation: High ripples and higher efficiency. Gives PWM output volatge on one of the pin and makes the other pin to be zero voltage.
	
Circuit Implementation done:	
1. Test board designed and printed.
2. Components soldered on the board.

Problems faced:
1. Unavailability of suitable inductors for reducing the ripples produced.
2. First PCB printed was smaller(scaled) due to software problems(incompatibility between softwares). This was later resolved by trial and error.
